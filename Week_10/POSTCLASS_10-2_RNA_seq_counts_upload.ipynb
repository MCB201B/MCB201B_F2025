    "In notebook 10-1, we aligned our RNA-seq reads to a reference genome using the splice aware aligner HISAT2, and today, we'll be counting our mapped reads in order to set up for our subsequent differential expression analysis. To do this, we'll make use of a program called HTSeq, which will allow us to count the reads mapped to different genomic features, and in the case of RNA-seq, we're interested in counting reads that have mapped to exons. Each group will then obtain raw counts for their control and TAZ KO replicates. We'll take a look at the data in our Python notebooks to do some basic QC, and then take a look to see if we might have some potentially differentially expressed genes just solely based on one replicate. Like for 9-1 and 10-1, we'll set up our scripts, then we can breakdown the code and concepts while our script runs.\n",

    "HTSeq (High-throughput sequence analysis in Python) is developed by Fabio Zanini, Simon Anders, Givanna Putri and contributors (<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/38/10/2943/6551247\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><u>Anders et al 2014</u></a>, <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/31/2/166/2366196\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><u>Putri et al 2022</u></a>). It's a Python package that acts as a framework for working with high-throughput sequencing data in Python. We will make use of its ability to count reads within features when provided with an alignment file and with a genome annotation file. We'll set up our bash scripts to check for <code>HTSeq</code>, and if needed, install <code>HTSeq</code> and if successful, run <code>htseq-count</code>. After you obtain your group's count data, you'll use this Python notebook to play around with the outputs to run some quick QC."
