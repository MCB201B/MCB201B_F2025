    "Today, we'll continue working with the data that we've collected from MCB201A as well as generating some hypothetical datasets to practice working in Python and running statistical analyses. Since today's lesson involves a lot of the skills you know, today will lean more towards independent exercises, since the concepts should be familiar to you from your own prior research experience and MCB201A. Now it is just translating that knowledge into Python code and understanding how our Python interpreter is seeing our data. At set points, we'll reconvene and see where everyone is at and also proceed with a couple of guided demonstrations.\n",

We will first pull out some descriptive statistics from our data and run a quick two-tailed t-test to evaluate if TAZ KO significantly impairs our MDA-MB-231 cells' ability to proliferate. Then, we will update our swarmplot with the results of our analysis and export our finished publication quality figure. You will practice setting up a function to use in subsequent analyses, and you will also learn a couple of ways to begin compacting your code.\n",

    "As you know from your lab reports, we can visualize our tumor engraftment data as a stacked bar plot. While <code>seaborn</code> has been helpful for us to plot swarmplots, <code>matplotlib</code> has the functionality for us to plot a stacked bar plot by taking advantage of its <code>plt.bar()</code> function. Recall from our earlier data visualization notebooks that we used this function to set up a simple bar plot, and now we'll use it to set up a stacked bar plot. <a href=\"https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.bar.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><u>Documentation for <code>plt.bar()</code> can be found here.</u></a>\n",

    "plt.bar(x, height, width=0.8, bottom=None, *, align='center', data=None, **kwargs)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see that there is a <code>bottom</code> parameter, which we left as the default before. This parameter sets the bottom of where a bar will go, and as a result, we can use it to stack bars one on top of another."
