    "Last week, we played around with our raw counts data in Python, and today, we'll switch over to R to start diving deeper into our counts. If you take a look at the kernel at the top right, you'll see that it's running using R rather than Python. We'll import our matrices that we created using our Python script, perform some normalization and filtering with DESeq2, and then use those values to perform a principal component analysis to get an idea of whether a notable difference exists between our control and TAZ KO replicates. By performing a principal component analysis on our replicates, we'll also be able to see whether there may have been batch effects that we may need to keep in mind in our analyses.\n",
