    "Welcome to MCB201B! As you've all had a little bit of practice now navigating your Biology Hub server and learning the basics of Python from MCB201A, we'll start off with a quick review of the things that you learned in Experiment 16, and then we'll expand some more on that by working through how we can use Python to streamline our analysis workflow. Towards the 2nd half of today's lesson, we'll then begin learning how we can use Python to visualize our data. \n",

Here, we'll have a mix of guided lessons where you follow along through some Python demonstrations, small in-class exercises that you'll have time to work on, and slightly more challenging exercises that will encompass more of what you've learned and give you the opportunity to apply it to situations you might encounter.\n",

The versatility of <code>matplotlib</code> makes it very helpful when creating publication quality figures.\n",
