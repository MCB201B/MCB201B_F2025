    "Welcome to MCB201B! As you've all had a little bit of practice now navigating your Biology Hub server and learning the basics of Python from MCB201A, we'll start off with a quick review of the things that you learned in Experiment 16, and then we'll expand some more on that by working through how we can use Python to streamline our analysis workflow. Towards the 2nd half of today's lesson, we'll then begin learning how we can use Python to visualize our data. \n",

Here, we'll have a mix of guided lessons where you follow along through some Python demonstrations, small in-class exercises that you'll have time to work on, and slightly more challenging exercises that will encompass more of what you've learned and give you the opportunity to apply it to situations you might encounter.\n",

    "For some basic data visualization, we'll first learn how to use <code>matplotlib</code>, which is an extensive Python library containing a lot of different packages and modules that allow us to generate simple graphs to more complex visualizations. It has functions to create any number of plots, and it can be used to create static, animated, and interactive plots. The versatility of <code>matplotlib</code> makes it very helpful when creating publication quality figures.\n",

    "You can find the documentation of matplotlib <u><a href=\"https://matplotlib.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here</a></u>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because it can get confusing at times to figure out how to set up a plot a certain way or what functions are available, a quick Google search can often aid in helping find the right code to get your data to plot the way you want it to (or you can also ask ChatGPT). So don't be afraid to look things up."

First, we will provide the function with a list containing our sample conditions, and then we provide it with another list which contains the mean relative absorbances.

For example, looking at our plot currently, you might notice that it's missing the Y-axis label and the X-axis tick marks can be adjusted to not all be entirely lowercase with no spaces.\n",
