    "This week, we gained an appreciation how quantitative approaches act as a microscope for biology, helping to reveal hidden mechanisms that our models may not have fully captured. We learned how numerical literacy can help us develop an intuition for the scales and numbers in biology, and when our expectations don't line up entirely with reality, that often means that our understanding of a phenomenon is incomplete, thereby revealing paths for further inquiry that deepen our understanding of biological phenomena. \n",
    "\n",
    "Like with physics and chemistry, mathematical models/simulations can be applied to the complexity and messiness of biology as well. Recall from lecture that in biology, a dialogue exists between theories and experiments, wherein theories shape the questions we ask and hypotheses we test. The resulting data and analyses then reshape and refine our theories and models, and the cycle starts again. The same dialogue exists for computational models and experiments. By taking what we know and translating it into mathematical equations, we can create computational simulations that generate predictions about some biological phenomenon. We can then take these predictions and test it against the results of real-world experiments, and discrepancies between the predictions of our computational models and empirical data indicate that our understanding is incomplete. Our computational models are then refined and further predictions can be made, and again the cycle repeats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we refresh ourselves with the fundamentals of for-loops with some independent exercises to start of this notebook reviewing operations that we've set up previously to help reinforce our understanding of for-loops. Then we'll expand a bit more on how we can add flexibility into our for-loops, and set up for-loops to build upon itself. Then we'll use for-loops to solve a simple mathematical equation (with some more plotting practice). Tomorrow, we'll take the concepts that we reviewed and learned and apply it to modeling biological phenomena.\n",
