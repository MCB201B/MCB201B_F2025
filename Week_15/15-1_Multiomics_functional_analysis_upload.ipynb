    "In notebook 13-1, we explored our transcriptome data at the level of each gene, and today, we'll take a look at our data with respect to groups of genes through a functional analysis of our differential expression results. While looking at the changes in expression of individual genes can provide insight into the gene-level impacts of experimental manipulations, we can also look for groups of genes that change together through functional analysis. This type of analysis can give us insight into broader biological changes that are occurring as a result of experimental manipulations, such as knocking down TAZ. So rather than asking about what is happening to a specific gene, we are instead asking about what biological processes, signaling pathways, or other functional groups are changing in our cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of particular interest to us is also how our transcriptome analysis intersects with our ChIP analysis. Recall that from our ChIP-seq analysis, we identified a set of reproducible peaks where TAZ-TEAD are likely to bind to DNA. Our analysis showed that TAZ-TEAD primarily bind to regions distant from the transcription start site (TSS) rather than the nearby promoter region, suggesting a longer range regulation of target gene expression through distant enhancers. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll be taking a basic multiomics approach by integrating our two big data analyses together in order to identify overlapping sets of genes from our two analyses. This approach can give us insight into the regulation of TAZ target genes and potentially identify some direct targets of TAZ and determine how TAZ regulates their transcription. We'll then take a look to see what functional groups are directly affected by TAZ KO compared to the overall changes that we see when we look at the full transcriptomic profile.\n",

Then the walk down the list is performed. This type of permutation ensures that the gene sets are constant between permutations, and by shuffling the assigned phenotypes for each of our samples, it creates a reference point for the level of enrichment when there is no differential expression in our data (a random ranking of genes). This permutation method requires that we have at least 7 samples for each condition, which we do. The stringency of this method allows us to use a cutoff FDR (q-value) of 0.25 rather than 0.05.\n",

So the reference point in this case is not a random ranking of genes but rather comparing the enrichment level to a hypothetical randomly generated gene set.
