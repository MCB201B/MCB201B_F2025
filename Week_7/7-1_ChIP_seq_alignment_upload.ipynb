Moreover, the sequence reads that we are trying to align are usually around 50-150bp with millions of read for each sequence file, and each of those reads needs to be aligned to the reference genome, which for humans is approximately 3 billion basepairs.\n",

While theoretically, you can align using the reference genome, converting the reference genome into an organized index enables faster searches through the genome to find alignments. As a result, <code>bowtie2</code> is able to efficiently and relatively quickly align sequence reads. To keep it's memory usage on the lower end, <code>bowtie2</code> uses an FM Index (which uses the Burrows-Wheeler Transform mentioned in lecture).\n",

Fortunately for us, bowtie2's documentation also provides a link to a pre-built index for hg19. The index files can be found in the shared folder for this course, and we've called them up when we ran our first alignment."
