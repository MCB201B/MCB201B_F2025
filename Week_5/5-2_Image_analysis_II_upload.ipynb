Today, we'll take what we know about how images are represented to extract quantitative information from our images and use that information to analyze our images to derive biological insights. First, we'll load in the single set of serum-starved and serum-stimulated cells that we worked with in in notebook 5-1, then run through an analysis to quantify the nuclear intensity of YAP after serum stimulation. Then, you'll work with a full dataset to then determine if there is a significant difference in YAP nuclear localization. \n",
