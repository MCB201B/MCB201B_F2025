    "We're now moving on to the ChIP-seq analysis module of this course. The goal of this module is to use big data analysis to identify the genes that may be regulated by TAZ by looking at the regions of DNA to which TAZ (and its associated TEAD DNA-binding protein) actually bind. In class, we'll practice using a truncated dataset to allow us to perform the analyses on a small subset of the larger dataset, and outside of class (aka for homework assignments), you will run the analysis using the full dataset. If there's time in class, you can also start running analyses on the complete dataset to save some time. The full dataset is rather large, so the analysis will take some time to run. You will want to keep this in mind, since your assignments will require you to turn in the results of your analysis.\n",

    "One of the main concepts that underlies ChIP-seq is a technique called chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Like with the more general technique of immunoprecipitation, ChIP takes advantage of the specificity of antibodies in order to select for specific proteins, namely proteins that interact with DNA either directly (such as histones) or indirectly through interactions with a DNA-binding protein (Park 2009).\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to immunoprecipitation, samples are crosslinked with formaldehyde in order to stabilize molecular interactions, such as protein-protein or protein-DNA interactions (<strong>Fig 1</strong>). Then the DNA is fragmented via sonication, producing smaller fragments of DNA ranging from 200 to 600 base pairs, with any associated proteins still bound to it. DNA fragmentation is followed by immunoprecipitation using antibodies specific to the target protein or interest. As the target protein is pulled down, any bound DNA is pulled down along with it, allowing us to enrich for the regions in which the target protein is closely associated. To release the DNA from the protein, the crosslinking reaction is reversed, and the DNA can be purified. Afterwards, a sequencing library is prepared from the released DNA fragments, and next-generation sequencing (NGS) is carried out.\n",

    "In a loose way, the organization of command line syntax isn't too different from Python. The <strong>prompt</strong>, while not present in Python, indicates the start of a command line. The <strong>command</strong> is like a function in Python, where it executes some pre-defined set of operations. The <strong>option</strong> and the <strong>argument</strong> can both be thought of as parameters for Python functions. Options alter how the command behaves, while arguments tell the command what it should operate on. OPtions are preceded by either a <code>&dash;</code> or <code>&dash;&dash;</code>, which indicate a short form (abbreviated) or long form option, respectively. Most commands have options that can be written in a short form or an equivalent long form, and you can find the different options for a command through its documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that there are sometimes two forms to an option, such as <code>&dash;h</code> and <code>&dash;&dash;help</code>, is kind of an artifact from when options used to have to be a single character."

    "<a href=\"https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>FastQC</u></a> is developed by Simon Andrews at the Babraham Institute in the UK. FastQC is a quick way to take a look at the quality of your raw sequence reads in order to get a general idea of how it looks and if there may be a bias in your data that could affect your analysis and/or interpretation of your data. There is a range of analyses that FastQC performs to assess the quality of your raw sequence reads, and they help you to get an idea of whether an issue may have occurred during sample prep, library prep, or sequencing.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of analysis modules with more detailed information and examples that can be found on <a href=\"https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/3%20Analysis%20Modules/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>the FastQC documentation pages.</u></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "While it is helpful to run FastQC to get an idea of the quality of your sequence data, you should also be aware that each library prep will be different and just because it shows up as a <strong>Fail</strong> in FastQC, it may be fine in the context of what you're studying. The results of the FastQC file may point you to where you may want to look if it the outcome is not what you expect."

    "The Illumina sequencing platform makes use of flow cells, which contain nanoscale wells that allow for clonal library amplification and subsequent sequencing by synthesis. If you recall from MCB201A and Dr. Ingolia's lectures, Illumina sequencing by synthesis technology uses fluorescently labeled nucleotides whose signal can be captured via imaging. Repeated images of the same section (a tile) of a flowcell allow for the sequence of the clonally amplified fragments to be read out as the progression of fluorescence signals when the clonal population of DNA fragments is extended. A tile is then considered a defined section of the flow cell that is repeatedly imaged, and a single tile can capture the sequences of a large number of clonal fragments (or clusters). Within a single flow cell, there are many, many tiles.\n",
