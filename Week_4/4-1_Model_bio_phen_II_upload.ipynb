Although earlier we referred to our <code>dt</code> as how often we're \"observing\" our <i>in silico</i> bacteria, we are really just predicting the number of bacteria expected to be at each time point. \n",

Something slightly less intuitive that you also need to consider is that with very small <code>dt</code>, rounding error will eventually limit how accurate your calculations can be. Recall that the way floats are represented in Python result in small inaccuracies, so at some point, these inaccuracies limit the exactness of your calculations.\n",

So after some given time step <strong>C(t+dt)</strong>, we can model the levels of mRNA by taking into account the number of mRNA that we had at the previous timepoint <strong>C(t)</strong>, how many mRNA were made in the interval <strong>(r times dt)</strong>, and how many decayed <strong>(gamma times dt times C(t))</strong>.\n",
    "\n",
    "That gives us the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "C(t+dt) = C(t) + r*dt - gamma*dt*C(t)\n",
    "```\n",
